# Play-Store-Apps-Analysis
SQL | Python | Data Analysis



In this project, I have worked with a real-world dataset from the Google Play Store, a widely used platform for downloading Android apps. The primary objectives of this project are to clean and preprocess the dataset using Python, perform in-depth analysis, and extract valuable insights using SQL. Thereby gaining practical experience in data cleaning, analysis, and information mining within a popular and extensive dataset, offering a comprehensive understanding of real-world data handling and analysis.
